TheForgottenFile

A short comical mystery video — coded entirely in Python.

🧩 About the Project

"TheForgottenFile" is a short, story-driven comic-style video where every frame, dialogue, and transition is generated through Python code.
It’s a fun experiment in blending data, storytelling, and design — because who says code can’t have a sense of humor (and mystery)?

🧠 Concept

A seemingly normal workday turns strange when a data analyst discovers a mysterious file on their laptop:

"DoNotOpen_Today.xlsx"

What follows is a light-hearted yet eerie digital adventure — created frame by frame through Python.
